Running the command gedit hello.sh opens the file hello.sh in the gedit text editor if it exists, or creates a new file named hello.sh if it does not exist. This allows you to view, edit, or create the script file directly. To ensure the script is executable after editing, you must run the command chmod +x hello.sh in the terminal. After making the script executable, you can run it using ./hello.sh.
