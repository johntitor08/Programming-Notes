The tabindex attribute in HTML is a global attribute that controls keyboard focus navigation, allowing developers to make elements focusable, remove them from the tab order, or rearrange their sequence. It accepts integer values: A value of 0 adds an element to the natural tab order based on its position in the HTML source; a negative value, typically -1, removes an element from sequential keyboard navigation but allows it to be focused programmatically via JavaScript. Positive values (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) can be used to set a specific order in the tab sequence, but their use is discouraged because they can disrupt the logical flow of the page and create confusing navigation experiences for keyboard and screen reader users. Best practices recommend avoiding positive tabindex values and instead relying on proper HTML structure and CSS for layout, using tabindex="0" only when necessary, such as for non-interactive elements with overflow: Auto that need keyboard scrolling, or for custom interactive widgets that lack native HTML elements.

Briefly:
The tabindex global attribute allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable (usually with the Tab key, hence the name) and determine their relative ordering for sequential focus navigation.
